## Executive Summary

Brain Tumour Detection is a production-ready, full-stack application for classifying MRI brain scans using deep learning. Built across twelve development modules, the system implements a complete three-tier architecture — React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and a Python/FastAPI AI service — containerised with Docker and deployed via GitHub Actions CI/CD.

The project delivers end-to-end functionality: dataset management, image preprocessing, multi-architecture model training, real-time inference with Grad-CAM explainability, JWT-secured APIs with role-based access control, system monitoring, and a performant production inference pipeline.

### Known Gap

The backend Jest suite has a configuration that expects `tests/*.js` files which have not been created yet. This is the only missing test coverage area. The backend logic is exercised indirectly through the frontend's API tests and the AI service integration tests.

## 11. TypeScript Fixes Applied (Module 12)

During final verification, the following TypeScript issues were diagnosed and resolved:

| File | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend/tsconfig.json` | `import.meta.env` not typed; `.jsx` components not resolved | Added `"allowJs": true` and `"types": ["vite/client"]` |
| `src/components/Button.d.ts` | No type declarations for JSX `Button` component | Created declaration file with `ButtonProps` interface |
| `src/components/BatchUpload.tsx` | `onDrop` used inline type instead of `FileRejection` from react-dropzone | Imported `FileRejection` type from `react-dropzone` |
| `src/api/client.test.ts` | `err` in catch typed as `unknown` — strict mode violation | Added explicit `as { status: number }` / `as { detail: string }` assertions |
| `src/hooks/useDataset.test.ts` | Variable used before assignment; `never` type narrowing in `act()` | Added explicit `DatasetValidationReport | null` type with `as` cast |

## 14. Known Limitations and Future Work

| Area | Current State | Recommended Next Step |
|---|---|---|
| Backend test suite | Jest configured but no test files created | Add `backend/tests/` with route-level integration tests |
| Model accuracy | Depends on training data quality and epochs | Integrate MLflow or Weights & Biases for experiment tracking |
| GPU support | TensorFlow auto-detects GPU if CUDA is present | Add `nvidia/cuda` base image variant for GPU-enabled deployments |
| Authentication UI | JWT auth fully implemented in API | Add login page and session management to the React frontend |
| Dataset size | Expects the Kaggle Brain Tumour MRI dataset | Document dataset download and preparation steps more explicitly |
| HTTPS | Nginx config is HTTPS-ready with certificate stubs | Integrate Let's Encrypt / cert-manager for production TLS |
| Horizontal scaling | Single-instance per service | Add load balancer config and shared model cache (Redis) for multi-instance |
